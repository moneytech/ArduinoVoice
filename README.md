This is an Arduino port of the [Sebastian Macke's port](https://github.com/vidarh/SAM)
of [Donâ€™t Ask Software's SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Automatic_Mouth),
which originally ran on C64, Atari and Lisa systems.

With the ESP32 or Teensy 3 DAC, it can create reasonably understandable
output.
